# Problem: LCM And GCD
>Tip: GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) and LCM (Least Common Multiple)

Given two integers a and b, write a function lcmAndGcd() to compute their LCM and GCD. The function inputs two integers a and b and returns a list containing their LCM and GCD.

#### Examples:
```
Input: a = 5 , b = 10
Output: [10, 5]
Explanation: LCM of 5 and 10 is 10, while their GCD is 5
```
#### Example 2:
```
Input: a = 14 , b = 8
Output: [56, 2]
Explanation: LCM of 14 and 8 is 56, while their GCD is 2.
```

#### Example 3:
```
Input: a = 1 , b = 1
Output: [1, 1]
Explanation: LCM of 1 and 1 is 1, while their GCD is 1.
```
#### Complexity:
```
Expected Time Complexity: O(log(min(a, b))
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)
```
> Constraints:
```
 1 <= a, b <= 109
```
