# Reverse String....
Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters s.

You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.
## Constraints:

- 1 <= s.length <= 105
- s[i] is a printable ascii character.


## Running Tests

To run tests, run the following command
- Example 1:
```bash
  Input: s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
  Output:    ["o","l","l","e","h"]
```
- Example 2: 

```bash
  Input: s = ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
  Output:    ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]
```
