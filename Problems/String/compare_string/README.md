## Comparision of two Strings.
    Two string are given. The program will check the and compare both strings,
    if strings are same the output will be shown as "Both are Equal String"
    else strings are not same, The output will be shown as "Both are different string". 
## Methods:
- By Using operators.
- By Traversing each element in char.
- Compare n element of a str with another.
## Running Tests

To run tests, run the following command
- Example 1:
```bash
  Input: s1 = "rabbar"
         s2 = "Rabbar"
  Output:    "Both are different string"
```
- Example 2: 
```bash
  Input: s1 = "newspaper"
         s2 = "newspaper"
  Output:    "Both are Equal String"
```

- Example 3: 
```bash
  Input: s1 = "NITIN"
         s2 = "nikhil"
  Output:    "Both are different string"
```
## Complexity :
