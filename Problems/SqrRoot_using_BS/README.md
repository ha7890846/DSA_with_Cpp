# Square Root BS Approach.
We can find Square Root of any number by using Binary Search Algorithm. It makes optimized solution and Result within of time  compexity - O( log n ), 

while Brute Force contains Time-compexity of - O( n ).
#### Precision : It is the number of significants after Decimal . 

## Running Tests

To run tests, run the following command

```bash
  Input: Number = 15
         Precision = 2
         
  Output = 3.87
```
```bash
  Input: Number = 16
         Precision = 3

  Output = 4
```
```bash
  Input: Number = 1200
         Precision = 3

  Output = 34.641
```



## Complexity Analysis :


| Type                | Description                |
| :-------            | :------------------------- |
| `Time Complexity`   | O( log n )        |
| `Space Complexity`  | O( 1 )           |
