Practise hands-on DSA.. It's My Fourth year of B.tech  and I lost my 3yrs without Learning. Now, We'll Go long Untill we don't meet our Goal. Hope All things Be Good.
Interviewers may ask questions about data structures and algorithms (DSA) to assess a candidate's ability to analyse problems, design efficient algorithms, and implement solutions using appropriate data structures. The questions can comprise topics including arrays, strings, linked lists, graphs, trees, algorithmic complexity and dynamic programming. If you are attending a technical interview, you can benefit from going through some commonly asked questions and ways to answer them effectively. In this article, we provide a list of DSA interview questions and their sample answers to help you prepare for the interview.
