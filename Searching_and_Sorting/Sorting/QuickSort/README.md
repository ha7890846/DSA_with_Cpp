# Merge Sort Algorithm

## Overview

Merge sort is a highly efficient sorting algorithm that follows the divide-and-conquer paradigm. It divides the input array into two halves, recursively sorts the halves, and then merges them to produce a sorted output.
## Complexity Analysis

- Best Case Time Complexity: O(n log n) - The best-case time complexity of merge sort is O(n log n) when the input array is already sorted.
- Average Case Time Complexity: O(n log n) - The average-case time complexity of merge sort is O(n log n) as it consistently divides the array into halves.
- Worst Case Time Complexity: O(n log n) - The worst-case time complexity of merge sort is O(n log n) when the input array is in reverse sorted order.
- Space Complexity: O(n) - Merge sort requires additional space proportional to the input size for temporary arrays during the merging phase.

## Implementation

The merge sort algorithm can be implemented in various programming languages.

```Cpp
# Example usage
arr = [12, 11, 13, 5, 6, 7]
sorted_arr = [ 5, 6, 7, 11, 12, 13];
